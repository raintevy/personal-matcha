    <h1>matcha!!</h1>

    <p class="backstory">
      hello! this page is for everything matcha (and a bit of hojicha). im currently looking for the best matcha and hojicha for lattes!!
      the criterias im looking for are: affordable (&lt;0.50$/gram), bold (strong flavor), creamy, deep green, sweet, full bodied, accessible
      <br><br> backstory: i started drinking matcha recently after being gifted a tin and being taught how to make it. now i find it to be a really relaxing part of my day and something i look forward to doing everyday! i used to drink coffee too and i think matchas a great substitute for it. i've tried usucha but i don't think its my thing.
      i've still got a lot to learn so take everything with a grain of salt TT

          notes: loveee love lovee this matcha. lighter flavor, first ever matcha ive made and tastes amazing.
          used whole milk so it kinda drowned out the flavor but still learning!
          didnt check proportions but usually used 4–5g, 30g cold water,
          two shots of vanilla syrup and half cup of whole milk.

          notes: delicous and very accessible! i got this matcha on black friday and rarely see it out of stock, the flavor is very similar to the daily matcha by mizuba tea. its refreshing and a solid option for lattes, i repurchased for a friend and would recommend it to people!

          notes: soooo good. super smooth and yummy. literally perfect for daily drinking. if the price wasn’t so high i would drink this 5g a day. hard to find, most of the time i check their website and its out of stock but i was lucky enough to catch a restock and it was so worth it !! the tin design and packaging is very pretty too

          notes: ippodo is a veryyy famous brand and ikuyo was recommended for lattes on their website ! bagged this one on black friday so shipping was free (for single purchases). the taste is amazing, very vegetal, grassy, refreshing, gorgeous green color. i wouldnt purchase again for the price but the taste is so so good

          notes: famous brand based in LA, was super excited to try this matcha. the tin is the best looking out of my whole collection, matcha was very earthy and umami. very different from the rest of the matchas before this. it was honestly really good, especially as a latte, but for the price point, i wouldnt repurchase it but id recommend people to try it if theyve never had rocky's matcha
